Database format: (base de données vs jeu de données)

Being able to download this dataset influenced my perception of a digital collection. Even though I had access to exact copies of archival databases, they still made it difcult to consider a dataset as a single entity, as a whole. In a database, information is scattered across a number of tables and in order to retrieve it, one has to formulate a precise query. Many cultural institutions mirror this paradigm of interacting with a collection online by providing search forms and APIs that return only a limited number of records. On GitHub, it is possible to download an entire digital collection as a single CSV file. In principle, one could create a single file export from any database, but this is not something the database paradigm afords – in the Gibsonian (1977) sense. Databases aford partial access, while downloading a file entails that all data is contained within that file. A study conducted by Harper et al. (2013) highlights how users see files as something they can own and manipulate, giving them a sense of control and completeness – both qualities that are useful also for analysing
data. (Kraütli 2016: 145)
